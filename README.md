# COVID-19-Data-Analysis
This Project is focused on analyzing Covid-19 data across different countries.
Which is also a data visualization application that explores and analyzes COVID-19 pandemic data across different countries using Python. It provides detailed graphical insights into confirmed cases, active cases, recoveries, deaths, and respective rates, helping users understand global pandemic trends.

## Project Structure

* `Sourcecode.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing all the code for data loading, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
* `country_wise_latest.csv`: The dataset used, containing country-wise COVID-19 statistics.
* `Output_Screenshots.pdf`: A collection of output screenshots of visualizations generated by the notebook.

## Key Features

* **Visualization of Confirmed, Active, Recovered, and Death Cases** by country.
* **Heatmap of COVID-19 Statistics** to show density and spread.
* **Pandemic Growth Trend Analysis** per country.
* **Bar Charts of Recoveries and Deaths** to identify top-affected and top-recovering countries.
* **Recovery Rate and Death Rate Comparisons** across the globe.

## Key Visualizations & Outputs

* Conformed Cases
* Active, Recovered and Deaths Report
* Stats of Countries through Heatmap
* Pandamic Growth per Country
* Recoveries per Country
* Deaths per Country
* Recovery Rate per Country
* Death Rate per Country

## Technologies Used

* **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
* **Pandas** for data manipulation
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** for visualizations
